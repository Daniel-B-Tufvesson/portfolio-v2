            <p>
                Unearthed is about exploration, survival, crafting, mining, 
                and most importantly automation! The game is set in a 
                procedurally generated 2D tile world. The player must collect resources 
                in order to make machines that can process those resources. And from these,
                the player can build further machines that collect even more resources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The project started in 2017 as a simple platformer game contained within 
                a small world. Over the years, both my skills and ambitions grew, and as
                well did the game. I have always loved games like Minecraft and Terraria, 
                and when playing them I regularly contemplate how one would go about making 
                such a game oneself. So it was only natural that I would try to implement
                something similar myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is far from finished, and the development is currently put on 
                hold. However, the game still has a lot of playable elements, and can
                be quite enjoyable despite being unfinished.

                crevices.

                with tools such as the pickaxe. There are many kinds of

                        a furnace. The furnace requires burnable fuel to operate,
                        and in this case coal is used.

            <p>
                As the game progresses, more and more advanced items can be 
                crafted, and these often require larger quantities of resources.
                To keep up with this increasing demand, the player can automate
                both the resource gathering and the crafting tasks. This is 
                done by crafting certain machines and assembling them into 
                factory production lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                These machines require electricity in order to operate.
                Electricity is generated with different kinds of electric
                generators, for example, solar panels or windmills. These
                generators can then be connected with cables to batteries
                and machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The machines also require items and resources to craft new 
                items. These items can be transported to and from the
                machines using pneumatic tubes. Items can also be stored in
                different storage containers when they are not being used.

                        from an underground coal deposit. The coal is then transported

                        crate.

        <app-project-section titleText="AI AGENTS">
            <p>
                The game has a number of AI agents, which can either be friendly
                or hostile to the player. The sophistication of their behaviors 
                varies from each kind of AI. Some are very simple, while others
                have more complex and autonomous behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The more sophisticated agents use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)&oldid=1178252094">behavior tree</a> 
                system that I implemented.
                Essentially, any given behavior can be broken down into a set
                of simpler behaviors. These in turn can be broken down again.
                Eventually the behaviors become so simple they don't have to 
                be broken down any more. In this way you can create complex
                and sophisticated behaviors from very simple, mindless 
                behaviors.
