                This was a project for a web development course at Link√∂ping University.
                The goal of the project was for each student to create their own creative
                but more or less useless input field. We were supposed to create something
                akin to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-worst-input-fields/">these</a>.
                Volume Space Program was my contribution.

                The task here is to launch a tiny rocket into orbit around the planet. The 
                rocket's distance from the planet determines the volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                When developing the idea for this, I knew I wanted to do something fun
                involving physics and gravity. It wasn't enough for it to be hard to use, 
                it should also be enjoyable; easy to fail, but easy to try again.

                The goal is essentially to achieve a stable orbit around the 
                planet. While hard, this is possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created the orbital mechanics from greatly simplifying Newton's 
                law of gravity, essentially saying, objects closer each other 
                attract each other more than those further away.

                Crashing the rocket drops debris into orbit. These follow the 
                same orbital mechanics as the rocket.
            </p>
            <p>
                After many crashes, space can become quite cluttered.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a final touch I added to give more depth to the 
                orbital mechanics. While it's not just quite mesmerizing 
                to watch, it also gives the player a sense that their actions 
                have an impact on the game world.
